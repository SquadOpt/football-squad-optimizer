"""Season ledger: the permanent record of live decisions and their outcomes.

A live recommendation that is acted on and then forgotten teaches nothing. The
ledger freezes each gameweek's decision at decision time — squad, projections,
provenance, the rendered report — and later attaches the realized outcome, forming
the season's out-of-sample series entry by entry. Entries are immutable and
checksummed like captured snapshots: a recorded decision can be proven to be the
decision that was made, or it cannot support any claim at all.

A mid-season decision carries a ``transfers`` block (`ledger_transfers_v1`): what
moved, what it cost, the bank and free transfers after, the purchase prices the next
week sells at, and the chip played. The opening entry has none; the state a second
deadline starts from is read out of the opening entry's own record.

New decisions also freeze ``vice_captain_player_id``, ``ordered_bench_player_ids``
and ``completion_policy``. These are additive fields within ``season_ledger_v1``:
existing fields keep their meanings, including the original ``bench_player_ids`` order.
``optimizer_projection_order_v1`` uses decision-time expected points (descending,
player ID to break ties), places the bench goalkeeper first, and chooses the best
non-captain starter as vice. It reads no realized outcome. Older records without these
fields remain valid and are never backfilled on read: absence means the completion
was not recorded, not that the original bench order was the declared substitution order.
Named-eleven outcome scoring is unchanged; recording completion does not apply autosubs.

Writes are crash-safe. A decision is assembled in a hidden staging directory next to
its final place, verified against its own manifest, and then moved into place with one
rename, so a gameweek directory either exists complete or does not exist at all; a
process that dies mid-write leaves only a staging directory that readers ignore and
the next writer prunes. A rename the operating system refuses only because it still
holds a handle on what was just written is retried briefly; a rename onto a destination
that already exists is not, because that is a refusal rather than a delay. One writer
per gameweek is enforced with an exclusive lock file, so two ticks cannot race the
immutability check. An outcome is written the same
way (temporary file, rename), and a manifest that was not rewritten after the outcome
landed is completed on the next call rather than refused — after the digests it already
records are verified, because completing it is a rewrite and a rewrite over drifted bytes
would bless them.
