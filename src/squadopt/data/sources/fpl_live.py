"""Adapter for a captured pre-deadline snapshot of the live Fantasy endpoints.

This module reads snapshot payloads that are already on disk. It never fetches,
which is what lets every test here run offline: capture is a deliberate step in a
script, and what arrives in this module is bytes.

What it produces is a *player snapshot*, not a canonical panel row. A canonical row
requires ``minutes`` and ``total_points``, and a roster read before kick-off has
neither. Inventing them to satisfy the canonical shape is exactly what the adapter
layer refuses to do, so the target here is the five deadline-known fields the
optimizer projection is assembled from: ``player_id``, ``name``, ``team_id``,
``position`` and ``price_tenths``.

The source publishes no contract and no documentation, so its shape is treated as an
observation rather than a promise. Every field this module depends on is checked and
named in the failure, because a renamed field must stop the run rather than quietly
produce a column of nulls.

    It is **not tolerant of a thinner payload**. A missing or renamed field stops the run

    quietly incomplete is worse than none, because the lookups that survive it look
    correct. For the same reason a repeated ``code`` is refused as well as a repeated

# --- season-relative element fields ------------------------------------------
#
# The element records carry cumulative counters -- minutes, total_points, starts and
# the rest -- and the number in them is not a property of the payload alone. Measured
# on the real captures (docs/capture_season_phase.md): in a capture taken before the
# opening deadline, 454 of 461 players carry *the previous season's* totals exactly,
# and after the season's first kick-off the platform resets them and begins the new
# season. Raya reads 3330 minutes and 162 points in the 2026-08-20 capture and 90
# minutes and 6 points afterwards; Saliba, who did not play, drops from 2614 and 137
# to zero.
#
# So the meaning of these fields flips at one instant, nothing in the payload states
# which side of it the capture sits on, and both readings are plausible numbers. That
# is a silent-wrong-answer shape, which is why they are named here and reached through
# one guarded entry point rather than read wherever they are wanted.

    The points are the platform's own running total per player. They are useful before a
    gameweek closes and they are *not* the settled outcome, so the two facts that decide
    what may be claimed from them travel in the same object rather than in a comment:

    - ``bonus_confirmed`` is false until every one of the gameweek's fixtures is finished.
      The platform adds bonus to a player's total only when his fixture finishes, so a
      score read earlier is short by up to three points per player, and short by different
      amounts for different players. That is not noise that averages out.
    - ``fixtures_finished`` against ``fixtures_total`` says how much of the gameweek is
      actually in the number, which is the difference between "your team scored 41" and
      "your team has scored 41 of what will be a larger figure".

    ``minutes_by_player`` travels here rather than in an object of its own because the two
    come out of one ``stats`` blob and because neither is sufficient alone: the platform's
    own score replaces a starter who played no minutes with a bench player, so a caller
    holding the points and not the minutes cannot say which eleven the points belong to.
    Which is why the key sets must match exactly -- a player whose minutes were dropped
    would read as "did not play", and the rule would field a substitute for a man who was
    on the pitch. This object supplies that rule's inputs; it does not apply it.

    Two limits are recorded rather than papered over, because both change what a consumer
    may claim.

    ``purchase_prices`` is empty and flagged unknown: the public endpoints publish no
    purchase price, so nothing here can say what any one player would sell for.
    ``squad_sell_value_tenths`` is the answer for the fifteen together, which the
    endpoints do publish, so a consumer can bound the budget without inventing the split.

    ``free_transfers`` is the rule floor of one, flagged unknown: the endpoints never
    state the banked count, and deriving it is a season-rules question this parsing layer
    does not answer. The banking model in ``squadopt.live.banking`` derives it from the
    same history (``entry_transfer_history``) and the application provider that builds
    the picks for a deadline sets the derived count in the parser's place.
