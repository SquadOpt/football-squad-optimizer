"""Export the in-season blend's own out-of-sample residuals.

    python -m scripts.export_in_season_residuals

The live risk layer describes a squad's spread by calibrating on a residual history, and
#45 states the rule that makes such a description honest: the residuals must belong to the
model that is making the decision. Calibrating one model's intervals on another's describes
the spread of something that is not deciding anything.

A control residual history already exists (`scripts.export_control_residuals`,
`docs/control_residual_export.md`), and it carries `model_version = form_window_05_v1` --
the archive-fed control. From gameweek two the live decision is made by
`in-season-carry-over-v1` instead, reading only what a capture carries, so that export
cannot calibrate it. This produces the missing one.

No optimizer runs here. A residual is a projection against an outcome, one row per player
per fold, so this is a minute of work rather than the benchmark's hour of CP-SAT. The folds,
the panel cut and the projection come from `scripts.measure_in_season_blend` rather than
being rebuilt, so the residuals describe exactly the model that benchmark measured and the
producer will hand to a live decision.

The locked holdout is never read: the panel is cut to the development seasons before
anything reads a feature window.
