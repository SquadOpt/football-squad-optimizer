"""Tests for the in-season blend benchmark.

The measurement itself takes an hour of CP-SAT and cannot live in a unit suite, so what is
tested here is everything that would make that hour produce a wrong number quietly:

- the locked holdout must be cut away before anything reads a feature window;
- every configuration must be scored on the *same* folds, because an unpaired fold is a
  smaller sample rather than an error;
- each fold must carry its season in metadata, because the interval helper skips a fold
  without one and would return an interval over fewer folds than the run claims.

The panel is synthetic and no optimizer runs: the pieces under test are the population, the
guard and the pairing, not the solver.
