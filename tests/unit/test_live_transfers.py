"""Tests for the mid-season transfer decision: from the held squad, through the ledger.

The opening decision builds a squad from nothing; every later one starts from what the
ledger holds. So the tests walk GW1 -> GW2 on the synthetic capture world: the held
squad is read out of the opening entry, the GW2 projection arrives as a producer's
handoff, transfers are decided under the game's rules, verified, frozen, and settled
with hits and the chip reflected. Refusals are tested as carefully as the happy path:
no handoff, no previous decision, an unpromoted model version, a chip outside its
window, a tampered handoff.
